   * @note (:|<|>|=|!=|<=|>=|%|\\(\\)): This part matches one of the specified symbols: :, <, >, =,
   *     !=, <=, >=, %, or (). The symbols are enclosed in parentheses for grouping.
   * @note ([\\w\\s\\(\\):@;,._-]+?): This part captures a group of word characters, whitespace
   *     characters, and specific symbols like (), :, @, ,, ;, ., _, and -. The +? makes the match

   *     is used as a delimiter to separate these components.
